# Hypland-dotfiles
This is Hyprland minimal rice just for star usage, something may change with time.
Just install Arch with kde plasma preinstalled and then:
sudo pacman -S hyprland kitty brightnessctl waybar wofi
Plasma should be for theme configuration(ecosystem) and in situation if this config will crash.
